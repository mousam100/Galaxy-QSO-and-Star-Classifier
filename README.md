# Galaxy-QSO-and-Star-Classifier
This project classifies stars, galaxies, and quasars using the SDSS dataset with 17 features. Preprocessing includes feature scaling and class balancing. Models like MLP, CNN, and LSTM are trained and evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices. The best-performing deep learning model is identified after training and validation on the dataset.
